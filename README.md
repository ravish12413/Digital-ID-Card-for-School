## How to Run this Project on Local Host 🖥️ ?

> **NOTE**: Ensure you set up Firebase and add the Firebase Configuration Object in the code before running the project. Scroll down to the **Firebase Setup** section for guidance.

> If you’re deploying the project on **Vercel**, skip this section and follow the steps in the **Deployment** section.


Below are the steps to run the project:
1. Download the Source Code 
2. Open the code with a Code Editor like VS Code
3. Open terminal within VS Code and run the following command: <b>node server.js </b>

```bash
node server.js
```


## How Does this Project Work 🤔 ?
1. Once the project is run, it opens the landing page (index.html). <br>
2. To Login or Signup, open the login.html page <br>
3. If you have signed up previously, you can directly login using the same email and password used in Signing Up <br>
4. If your account is not created, you will need to create an account. To create an account, you need to provide Username, Email and Password.<br>
5. The username to generate the publically link. Your Digital Business Card link will be : <your-deployment-domain.com>/username . For instance, if you are running this project in localhost, then your link will be: localhost: PORT/username <br>
5. After Signing up, you will receive an email to verify the email you provided. You will not be able to login unless you verify the email. <br>
6. Verify the Email and log in. You will be navigated to Dashboard Page after logging in. <br>

## Understanding File Structure 📂

Root/<br>
├── node_modules/ <br>
├── Public/ <br>
├── server.js <br>
├── package.json <br>
├── package-lock.json <br>
├── vercel.json<br>


Here's an explanation of the purpose of each file or folder in your project directory structure:

### Explanation:

1. 📁 **`node_modules/`**  
   - This folder contains all the Node.js packages and dependencies installed via npm (`npm install`).  
   - It is automatically generated based on the `package.json` file. You generally do not modify this folder manually.

2. 📁 **`Public/`**  
   - This folder contains all static assets of this project, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other frontend files.  
   - It serves as the public-facing part of the application, accessible to users through the browser.

3. 📄 **`server.js`**  
   - This is the entry point for the Node.js server application.  
   - It typically contains the server configuration, routes, and logic for handling incoming requests. In this project, running `node server.js` starts the server on `localhost:3000`.

4. 📄 **`package.json`**  
   - This file defines the project, including its name, version, description, and dependencies.  
   - It also specifies scripts for running or building your application and other metadata like author information.  
   - Dependencies listed here are installed into `node_modules` when you run `npm install`.

5. 📄 **`package-lock.json`**  
   - This file locks the exact versions of the dependencies and their nested dependencies used in the project.  
   - It ensures consistent installations across different environments.

6. 📄 **`vercel.json`**  
   - This file contains configuration settings for deploying this project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).  
   - It may specify build and deployment settings, environment variables, routing, and more, to tailor the deployment process to your application's needs.


## Firebase Setup 🔥
We require to use two Firebase Services for this project- Realtime Database and Authentication. We store the data in the Realtime Database and use Authentication for Login / SignUp and verification purposes.

1. Create a Project in Firebase
2. Once you have created the project, click on Realtime Database under Build from the left sidebar menu.
3. Click on Create database.Let the location of the database be United States (us-cental1). Choosing a different location may lead to unexpected challenges.
4. Start the database in lock mode
5. Now make necessary nodes as shown below:
![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cdc5442-a24c-486e-aa8e-b1507355761a) <br>

NOTE: Make nodes as provided above. Any change in the name of the node will cause issues in the projet. <br> <br>
6. After you have created the structure of your database, click on rules and update it with the following: <br>

```json
{"rules": {
  "Binding": {
    "$uid": {
      ".read": "auth != null && auth.uid === $uid",
      ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid === $uid"
    }
  },
  "Collected Data": {
    "$username": {
      ".read": "true",
      ".write": "auth != null && root.child('Binding').child(auth.uid).child('username').val() === $username"
    }
  },
}
}
```
